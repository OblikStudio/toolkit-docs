Oblik Toolkit is a collection of minimal and extensible JavaScript components and utilities, created and maintained by (link: https://oblik.studio/ text: Oblik Studio target: _blank). It's not focused on reactivity like Vue or React. It's also not a framework with predesigned components like Bootstrap. What it _does_ focus on are just interactive behaviors. Things like parallax and scroll effects, sliders, etc.

The toolkit can be compared to (link: https://getuikit.com/ text: UIKit target: _blank), from which it has drawn a lot of inspiration. The main difference is that Oblik focuses solely on the JavaScript parts and depends on CSS as little as possible, leaving styling in your hands.

The main goals of the project are:

1. Giving you components with logic for interactive behaviors
2. Allowing you to easily extend those components or create your own
3. Providing a way to easily use components with just HTML attributes

## Architecture

- Components are expressed as ES6 classes in ES6 modules
- TypeScript is used to provide stability and enhance the developer experience
- Code is compiled down to ES5 to support browsers up to IE11

Instead of providing do-it-all solutions, the target of Oblik is to give you (link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS text: object-oriented target: _blank) components that:

- are straightforward
- handle the majority of use cases
- can be configured through (link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain text: inheritance target: _blank)

Oblik is meant to be used as a dependency in your project where you import just the things you need. However, you could also use it straight from a CDN.
