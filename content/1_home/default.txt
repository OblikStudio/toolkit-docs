Oblik Toolkit is a collection of minimal and extensible JavaScript components and utilities. It's not focused on reactivity like Vue, React, Angular, etc. It's also not a framework with predesigned components like Bootstrap. What it _does_ focus on is just the interactive behaviors. Things like parallax and scroll effects, sliders, etc.

The toolkit can be compared to [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/), from which it has drawn a lot of inspiration. The main difference is that Oblik focuses solely on the JavaScript parts and depends on CSS as little as possible, leaving styling in your hands.

The main goals of this project are:

1. Giving you components with logic for interactive behaviors
2. Allowing you to easily extend those components or create your own
3. Providing a way to easily use the components with just HTML attributes

## Architecture

- Components are expressed as ES6 classes encapsulated as ES6 modules
- TypeScript is used to provide stability and enhance developer experience
- Code is compiled down to ES5 to support browsers up to IE11

Oblik is meant to be used as a dependency in your project where you import just the things you need. However, you can also use everything straight from a CDN. (link: #todo text: Usage).

## Examples

The most direct way to use a component is to simply import it and attach it to an element with JavaScript. Here's an example with the (link: #todo text: Carousel) component:

(example: slider)
