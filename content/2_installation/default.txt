Title: Installation

Content:

## With a package manager 

Using (link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/oblik text: npm target: _blank):

```text
npm install oblik
```

Using (link: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/oblik text: yarn target: _blank):

```text
yarn add oblik
```

## From a CDN

You can load a bundle with all components and utilities from (link: https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/oblik text: jsDelivr target: _blank):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/oblik@latest/dist/oblik.js"></script>
```

**Note:** This will load **everything** from Oblik. If you have a build setup, it would be better to use a package manager, download Oblik, and import just the things you need. It's designed to be used like that.
