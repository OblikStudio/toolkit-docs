Title: Poller

----

Content:

Uses the (link: ticker text: Ticker) to poll for changes on an object. For example, this is useful for detecting when an element's size changes, since there's no DOM event for that.

**Note:** Although the poller fires on [`requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), be wary for performance issues. Make sure to check if there's an alternative to polling.

```js
import { Poller } from 'oblik/utils/poller'

let el = document.querySelector('.my-element')
let poller = new Poller(el, 'offsetWidth', 'offsetHeight')

poller.on('change', changes => {
	console.log(changes.offsetWidth?.newValue)
	console.log(changes.offsetHeight?.newValue)
})
```
