Title: Animation

----

Content:

Interpolates between `0` and `1` over a duration. Extends the (link: utilities/tween text: Tween) and does pretty much the same thing except it automatically executes itself on [`requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) until the end is reached.

```js
import { Animation } from 'oblik/utils/animation'
import { easeOutQuad } from 'oblik/utils/easings'

let anim = new Animation(500, easeOutQuad)
anim.on('update', console.log)
anim.run()
```

In the `update` event, you can use the current value to make an animation effect.

## Events

### `start`

Fired when the animation enters a running state.

### `update(value: number)`

Fired when the value is updated and that value is passed as the first argument.

### `end`

Fired after the last step of the animation has run, i.e. when it has completed.

### `stop`

Fired when the `stop()` method is called.
