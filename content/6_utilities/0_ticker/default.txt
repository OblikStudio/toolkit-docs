Title: Ticker

----

Content:

Uses `(link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame text: requestAnimationFrame target: _blank)` to continuously emit a `tick` event and provide the passed time since the last tick. This is used in the (link: utilities/animation text: Animation) utility to execute the logic on each frame.

```js
import { Ticker } from 'oblik/utils/ticker'

let ticker = new Ticker()

ticker.on('tick', delta => {
	// `delta` is the time in milliseconds
	// since the last call
})

ticker.start()
```
