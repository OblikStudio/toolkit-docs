Title: Carousel

----

Content:

- Has touch support
- Sliding can be animated with CSS transitions
- Active slide is changed based on swipe speed, rather than distance
- Pure CSS option for infinite sliding (via CSS flex order)
- Gap between items is controlled with CSS
- Items per row is controlled with CSS and works responsively

(example: slider-watcher active: result)

## Components

- `rail` contains all slides and it should have CSS applied to it that orders the slides on a single row
	- `item` (multiple) are the slides and can have horizontal CSS `margin` applied to make gaps between them
- `next` moves to the next slide on click
- `prev` moves to the previous slide on click

## Options

All the following options are applied to the `rail` component.

### `infinite`

Whether the carousel can be scrolled indefinitely.

**Default:** `false`

### `itemsPerScreen`

Although you can control items per screen via CSS, you can explicitly specify it.

### `overdrag`

Ratio for how far the user can drag beyond the first/last item. If the carousel width is `400px` and `overdrag` is `0.5`, then the distance will be `200px`.

**Default:** `0.3`

### `screenChangeSpeed`

The minimum swipe speed (in pixels per second) that is needed to change the active slide.

**Default:** `500`

### `clickThreshold`

If the user dragged less pixels than this value, the drag will be considered a click. This is needed for when the slide is also and `<a>` tag.

**Default:** `40`
