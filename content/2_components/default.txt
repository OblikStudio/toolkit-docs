Title: Components

----

Content:

If you need something more, components provide advanced functionality. They are simple classes (constructor functions) with three arguments:

- `element` to which they are attached to
- `options` that alter the component's behavior
- `parent` component

To be more organized, components are divided into three groups:

- _functional_ do small things like scrolling to a part of the page, monitoring an element's height so it can be animated with CSS, toggling a class based on some user event...
- _interface_ provide the usual slider, accordion, masonry grid...
- _misc_ do random stuff like allowing you to use an HTML element as cursor, splitting text in an element by words so you can animate them...
