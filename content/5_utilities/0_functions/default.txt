(link: https://lodash.com/ text: Lodash target: _blank)-like helper functions.

### `isObject`

```ts
function isObject (input: any): input is object
```

Checks if the input is `typeof 'object'` and not `null`.

### `merge`

```ts
function merge (target: object, ...sources: object[]): any
```

Recursively merges own properties from `sources` to `target`. Used in components to merge default options with input options.

### `debounce`

```ts
function debounce<T extends (...args: any) => any> (
	callback: T,
	time: number
): (...args: Parameters<T>) => void
```

Implementation of (link: https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/#debounce text: debounce target: _blank), which "groups" multiple sequential calls to a function in a single one.

### `throttle`

```ts
function throttle<T extends (...args: any) => any> (
	callback: T,
	time: number
): (...args: Parameters<T>) => void
```

Implementation of (link: https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/#throttle text: throttle target: _blank), which prevents a function from executing more than once every X milliseconds.
