Title: Scroll To

----

Content:

Smoothly scrolls to an element with a specified (link: utilities/easings text: easing). Can also be bound globally so that all hash links are smoothed out.

(example: scroll-to active: result)

## Options

### `duration`

Length of the animation.

**Default:** `1000`

### `easing`

An (link: utilities/easings text: easing) function.

**Default:** `easeOutQuint`

### `target`

Element that should be scrolled into view.

**Default:** `undefined`

### `offset`

If `target` is specified, `offset` will simply be added to the target element's position. Otherwise, it will scroll to `offset` pixels past the document top.

**Default:** `0`

### `interruptible`

Whether the scroll animation can be interrupted by user input, such as mouse scroll or touch.

**Default:** `true`

## Link easing

If you want to have smooth scrolling for all hash links, you have to use the static `clickHandler()` method and add the resulting function as a `click` listener:

```ts
import { ScrollTo } from 'oblik/components/scroll-to'

document.addEventListener('click', ScrollTo.clickHandler())
```
